# Day 14

🎯 Day 14 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Excel Escape Room Puzzle Game

Today’s project was one of the most fun and creative ones yet — I built a fully functional Excel-based escape room game! 🔐


✅ What I accomplished:

  - Designed a logic puzzle with a riddle and a single-entry answer field

  - Used data validation to guide the player input

  - Applied conditional formatting to instantly show if the answer is correct (green) or incorrect (red)

  - Added a ✔️ celebratory message with VBA when the puzzle is solved!


📌 The answer field unlocks the “door” (cell), and solving the riddle gives players an interactive, satisfying mini-game — all within Excel. No add-ins, just smart formulas and formatting!

🧠 This project highlights how Excel can be a platform for interactive games, training exercises, or even just creative challenges — it’s more than just a spreadsheet tool.

🕒 Time spent: ~1 hours
